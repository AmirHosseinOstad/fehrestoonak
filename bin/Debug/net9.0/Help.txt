If you also have trouble remembering your tasks, this is your solution!

Each task is stored in a txt table, note that ,, and ;; are used to separate the columns and rows of the table, and for this reason these are forbidden characters.
The input value must be more than 3 letters long and three-letter words are not valid.

If you don't need a command, just enter the task subject and press enter to save it in the table,
Otherwise, you can see the list of tasks by giving the specific command "list".
If you have done a task (by default, its status is in progress), just give the command "done{ID}" and enter the task number instead of the {ID}.
To remove a task from the list, simply type the command "-del{ID}" and replace {ID} with the task code.
